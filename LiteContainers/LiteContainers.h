//  The purpose of LiteContainers is to wrap C-style arrays in Objective-C code in order
//  to avoid the overhead associated with NSArray & NSMutable array, and especially with
//  with Swift's Array type.
//
//  This Lbirary was written with the explicit purpose of being used in Swift programming.
//  It was not designed with Objective-C programming in mind. However, the containters
//  are very much usable at the Objective-C level.
